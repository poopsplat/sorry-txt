Dear Developer,

I'd like to take this opportunity to apologize for the code I've left you to work on. It's not all bad, but there are plenty of areas that are in need of a lot of love and improvement. You know how it goes — you start out on a project writing super semantic and lean code and then things get piled on, and features get added, and before you know it your beautiful project structure turns in to a Frankenstein of code snippets and Stack Overflow answers. I know what it is like to pick up on a project that's filled with spaghetti code — it sucks. I wish I could tell you that I had enough time to ensure that this project was easy to pick up on and pass off, but the truth is I just didn't have that time, and things got slopped together as roughly and quickly as was needed to get the job done.

I know this apology is probably of little consolation to you, but I wanted you to know I sympathize with the task you have ahead of you.

Best of luck,
Pat.
