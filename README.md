Sorry.txt
=========

**A sorry note to developers for the crappy code you might be leaving them with.**

We have all been there — we are handed a project with a tiny budget and a tiny timeline, and you just have to get the thing done. Or there _was_ a decent budget and timeline but it got cut short and you have to scrap together what you can to get the thing out the door. 

For these situations, when you might be a little embarrassed about the code you're putting out there, try adding a `sorry.txt` document to the project and let the next developer know that you are sorry about the condition the code is in. You can get as specific as you want, but that's more what a `README` is for — this is for your ego. Let the next developer know that you totally botched the job, and that you're sorry. Maybe apologizing will convince them to spare you a public shaming, or if you milk it hard enough, maybe even feel bad for you! You do run the risk of the odd butthole taking it as a sign of weakness and being even angrier about it (afterall, if the developer wasn't aware they were writing terrible code maybe it's excusable?). 

### Tips

* Be vague — you're only here for sympathy
* If the code is bad enough, you might want to use a fake name to sign it with
* If you intentionlly write crappy code 'cause you just don't care, include this anyway, it might give the illusion that you care.

### Example

=========

Dear Developer,

I'd like to take this opportunity to apologize for the code I've left you to work on. It's not all bad, but there are plenty of areas that are in need of a lot of love and improvement. You know how it goes — you start out on a project writing super semantic and lean code and then things get piled on, and features get added, and before you know it your beautiful project structure turns in to a Frankenstein of code snippets and Stack Overflow answers. I know what it is like to pick up on a project that's filled with spaghetti code — it sucks. I wish I could tell you that I had enough time to ensure that this project was easy to pick up on and pass off, but the truth is I just didn't have that time, and things got slopped together as roughly and quickly as was needed to get the job done.

I know this apology is probably of little consolation to you, but I wanted you to know I sympathize with the task you have ahead of you.

Best of luck,
Pat.
